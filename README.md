# Overlay Enabler
Show your observer overlay right on the observer screen
## How to use:
WIP, but in short: 
```
.\OverlayEnabler.exe <url> //eg: https://spectra-official.b4iterdev.net.eu.org/overlay
```
Press `Ctrl + E` to exit, `Insert` to toggle show/hide, `Ctrl + R` to reload page.

For games, you must set to Fullscreen Windowed, or the overlay won't show
